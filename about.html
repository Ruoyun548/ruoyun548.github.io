			<p>Hello! This is Ruoyun Liu.</p>

			<p>I am a graphic design and photography student at the University of Massachusetts. I really enjoy the process of conveying information through design patterns and words, and I love to record every bit of my life with the camera. I came all the way to the United States to study because of my love for life and art.</p>

			<p>But my life is not only about learning, I prefer to enjoy life. I have a cat, I like to play guitar and ukulele in my spare time, published my own compositions on the Internet, participated in cooperative game competitions and won the championship.</p>

			<p>I think I have experienced a lot and seen a lot in the days when I was alone. I believe that my experience will become the inspiration for my creation at some point. Therefore, I believe That I will become a good artist.</p>
